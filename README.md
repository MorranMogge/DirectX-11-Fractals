The engine is capable of calculating and drawing different fractals to the screen.
ImGui has been a big help in this project.

Supported fractals:

Mandelbrot set:

Julia set:

Input fractals: (for this example z = z * z * z + c was used), currently has some issues with certain inputs

I also added the ability to zoom into the fractal

Pictures showing the Mandelbrot set zoomed in at (-0.015, -0.738):

This is currently a work in progress and I have plans to add more features.
